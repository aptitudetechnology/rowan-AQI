A biological CO2 sensor is actually quite feasible since many organisms naturally sense CO2 levels! Here are several approaches:

**Direct CO2 Binding Proteins:**
Engineer variants of **carbonic anhydrase** - the enzyme that converts CO2 to bicarbonate. You could modify it so that CO2 binding triggers a conformational change that activates gene expression rather than catalyzing the reaction. The binding affinity could be tuned for specific PPM ranges.

**pH-Based Detection:**
CO2 dissolves in water to form carbonic acid, lowering pH. Engineer **pH-sensitive proteins** that change conformation as CO2 levels alter the cellular pH environment. Many natural proteins have pH-dependent activity that you could harness.

**Metabolic Sensing:**
Create a system where CO2 availability directly affects a engineered metabolic pathway. For instance, engineer a modified RuBisCO (the CO2-fixing enzyme from photosynthesis) that produces a fluorescent reporter molecule proportional to CO2 concentration rather than fixing carbon.

**Bicarbonate Transport Systems:**
Many cells have CO2/bicarbonate transporters. Engineer these so that CO2 transport activity triggers downstream signaling cascades that produce measurable outputs like fluorescence intensity.

**Natural Inspiration:**
- **Cyanobacteria** have sophisticated CO2-concentrating mechanisms with sensors
- **Plant stomatal cells** detect CO2 levels to control pore opening
- **Chemotactic bacteria** can sense CO2 gradients for navigation

**Ratiometric Approach:**
Use two engineered pathways - one that's active at low CO2, another at high CO2. The ratio of their outputs (different colored fluorescent proteins) correlates with CO2 PPM after calibration.

**Measurement Range:**
You could potentially engineer sensitivity anywhere from atmospheric levels (~400 PPM) to much higher concentrations, depending on the binding affinity of your sensor protein.

This might actually be easier than humidity sensing since CO2 directly participates in cellular metabolism, giving you more natural mechanisms to exploit.
